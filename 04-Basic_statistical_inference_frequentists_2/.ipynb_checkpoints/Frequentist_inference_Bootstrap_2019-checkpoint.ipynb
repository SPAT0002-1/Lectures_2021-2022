    "## II.4 Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap is a method for estimating standard error (and confidence intervals on some statistical quantities / aka statistics) using your observed sample of random variable to estimate the population distribution of your statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you have a random variable $x$, and have n measurements $\\{x_i\\}$ of it. Then you may want to measure some statistics (let's say $q = g(x_1, ..., x_n)$) of the pdf of $x$ (e.g. its mean, its median, its variance, ...) and find out how precise is that statistics (i.e. measure the variance or confidence interval associated to that stat.). In general, you do not know the distribution $h(x)$ from which are drawn your data, and therefore you do not know the one of $q$. You only have an estimate $\\hat{h}(x) \\, \\equiv\\, f(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) \\, = \\, \\frac{1}{n} \\, \\sum_{i=1}^n \\, \\delta(x - x_i),  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta(x)$ is the dirac function. This choice of $f(x)$ is also the one that maximizes the likelihood, i.e. $p(x_i  \\, | \\, f)$. Now that we have an estimator of $h(x)$ we can draw samples from $f(x)$ (as we did when we used Monte-Carlo to derive pdf for virtually infinite samples of random variables), and study the distribution of our statistical quantity (i.e. estimate its variance, confidence interval, ...). This is exactly as we did when we carried out Monte-Carlo simulations *except* that instead of drawing samples from a known pdf $h(x)$ we do it from our estimator of the pdf $f(x)$.    \n",
    "\n",
    "If our sample contains $n$ elements, then, there are $n!$ possible distinct samples of size n we can draw , and a probability $n!/n^n$ that we draw a sample identical to the original data (i.e. for 10 elements, $n!/n^n \\sim 3.6\\,10^{-4}$.).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "- You have: $x=\\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\}$\n",
    "- You then draw $B$ samples $\\{x^*_1, x^*_2, ..., x^*_n\\}$, where $x^*_i$ is randomly picked among the $x$ (with replacements, i.e. it could be that one of your $B$ samples will be $\\{x_1, x_1, ...,x_1\\}$ !). In other words, for each bootstrap sample, you generate random n indices in the range $[1, ..., n]$  (in `python`, you can use `np.random.randint(low, high, size)` or `scipy.random.randint()` or `np.random.choice(mysample, size)` to generate n random integers) to build your bootstrap sample from the original sample. \n",
    "- Then, as we did with Monte-Carlo simulations, you can estimate from each of these $B$ samples your statistics $\\hat{q}$ and study its distribution, or more specifically derive its variance, confidence interval, ... If the statistics you derive from bootstrap is e.g. the mean of the population distribution, and if $q_B = {q^*_1, q^*_2, ..., q^*_{nboot}}$ is the ensemble of means derived from bootstrap, then the standard deviation of $q_B$ (i.e. $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum (q^*_i - \\bar{q_B})^2/(n_{boot}-1)}$) yields a bootstrap estimate of the standard error on the mean. Indeed, the bootstrap allows you to derive the destribution of your statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Sometimes, instead of using $f(x)$ as derived directly from the sample, one uses its \"best fit model\" $f(x \\, | \\, \\hat{\\theta})$, this is then called *parametric bootstrap*.  \n",
    "There is complete books dedicated to bootstraps and its subtleties (especially if the errors on your random variable are not identical, effects related to the size of your sample, ... ). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a random sample $x$ of $N=100$ measurements drawn from a normal gaussian distribution $N(0,4)$. This is assumed to be your data set. \n",
    "- Calculate a bootstrap estimate of the mean and the standard error on the mean. Compare the value of the standard error on the mean you expect for a sample of 100 points,  (i.e. $\\sigma/\\sqrt(n-1)$) to the value derived with the bootstrap. Consider a bootstrap sample of $n_{boot} = $ 1000. \n",
    "- Calculate an estimator of the std $s = \\hat{\\sigma}$ of your distribution and its associated (standard) error. \n",
    "- How do those values compare to the expected distribution (based on the fact that the population distribution of x is N(0,4) ? *TIP*: the Standard error on $s$ is $ stde(s) = s / \\sqrt{2(npts-1)}$.   "

    "\n",
    "- You have learned 2 different techniques to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals for a statistics of a sample: the `bootstrap` and the `jacknife`. \n",
    "- The key concept of the bootstrap is that you generate fake samples (called bootstrap samples) based on the sample in hands (randomly picking elements from the original sample, *allowing for repetion*), and study the distribution of the statistic of interest based on this bootstrap sample. \n",
    "- The key concept of the jacknife consists in creating fakes samples (called jacknife samples), each jacknife being sample being the same as the original one, but with one point removed. The statistics of interest can be derived from this ensemble of jacknife samples (the mean and variance of the sample are derived using specific formula given in #II.4.2-Jacknife). \n",
    "- Since this method yields a distribution of the statistics of interest, it is possible to calculate a confidence interval based on the bootstrap of on the jacknife distributions. \n",
    "- Three ways to calculate a confidence interval from a bootstrap sample of a specific statistics have been presented: the \"normal interval\" (assuming the distribution is gaussian), the \"percentile interval\", and the \"Pivotal confidence interval\".  \n",
    "- We can use the function `np.percentile()` to calculate a confidence interval for an array containing a statistic of interest (e.g. a bootstraped mean; or any array containing multiple realisation of a statistic of interest). \n",
    "- The maximum size of the bootstrap sample is given by $n!/n^n$, where $n$ is the number of points of the sample. \n",
    "- The package `astropy.stats` provides an implementation of the bootstrap and of the jacknife resampling. Those implementations can be used in real life but not to solve the problems given in this lecture (or at the exam). "
