    "\n",
    "We have seen the main structures/objects (e.g. `list`, `dictionary`) during the last lecture as well as methods attached to those (e.g. `list.append(val)`). We have also seen how to build functions (kind of scripts that allow you to automatize some sequences of operations). The  Notebook `Recap_python_L1.ipynb` summarizes the main things we have learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you quit from the `Ipython` interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you better use a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended. When you want to make use of a module in a program or in an interactive window, you should simply do: \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import module\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, you call functions in you script simply by doing `module.funtion()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Example **: \n",
    "In file `myawesomemodule.py`, we have written\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def talk():\n",
    "    print 'What do you want master ?'\n",
    "    return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in Ipython/Jupyter, you can simply do: \n",
    "``` python \n",
    "import myawesomemodule\n",
    "myawesomemodule.talk()   # call the function talk() you have defined in myawesomemodule.py\n",
    "    Out: 'What do you want master ?'\n",
    "\n",
    "# you can also do this the following way\n",
    "import myawesomemodule as ms\n",
    "ms.talk()\n",
    "\n",
    "# or, if you want to only call the function talk:\n",
    "from myawesomemodule import talk\n",
    "talk()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you'll also hear about *packages*. *Packages* are simply ensemble of modules, and you load/import them the same way you do for modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:**\n",

    "In python, there is `.pyc` files often generated with the same name as the module/~~script~~ you are importing/~~running~~. Imagine you have a module `sayhello.py`. When you import your module the first time, a file `sayhello.pyc` will be created, that contains an already-\"byte-compiled\" version of `sayhello.py` to speed up the execution. The modification time of the version of `sayhello.py` used to create `sayhello.pyc` is recorded in `sayhello.pyc`, and the `.pyc` file is ignored if these don't match. A program does not run faster when read from a `pyc` instead of a `py`, but **it is loaded** more quickly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have loaded your module in an `Ipython` and then modify it with an editor, it won't account directly for your modifications (because the `pyc` has not been re-compiled).

    "- `PYTHONPATH` (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH).\n",

    "After initialization, Python programs can modify `sys.path`. The directory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of the search path, ahead of the standard library path.

    "TIP: You can create your own modules ovbiously, but one of the great asset of python is the availability of a **huge** library of third-party modules, often designed by scientists for scientists (including astronomers !). Some of these modules introduce new structures/objects that you may have to masterize/understand by yourself. There is some modules that **YOU NEED TO KNOW** to efficiently work on data-science related projects: `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib` ... We will extensively use those modules when studying numerical methods for data analysis. \n"

Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python.

    "#### Formatting Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "It often happens that you do not need to save all the decimals of a number, or would like to see it in scientific notation. For that purpose, you need to use the `%` operator to specify the formatting of the variable you want to show at the screen or save in a file. The variable does not appear explicitly in the string but after it in a tuple, preceded by the `%`. Within the string, the `%` operator will be followed by a format string such as `%f` for a float or `%e` for scientific notation. The sequence `'%.2f'%variable` basically tells that the `%` operator converts the variable into a float with 2 digits after the dot. This is generalized to a sequence of variable, by defining the tuple object that contains all the variables to be formatted (but you need to specify the format you want for those, the association between the format and the variable being done easily as you have put your variable into a tuple-object).   \n",

    "\n",
    "For now, we have basically only used in-line coding and reading/writing results at screen/in files. This is nice but for an interactive language one would like to be able to visualise/plot results easily, without using other software. Even better, one would like to be able to generate publishing-quality figures. This capability to visualize data/results with a high flexibility and generate the figures you will present in your paper/report/poster is fortunatelly also one of the strengths of `Python` ... People sometimes complain that generating figures that match exactly what you aim at is not always easy ... This is *partly* true. As you'll see below, you can already do a lot with the basic commands you have access with matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is `matplotlib` ?* Matplotlib is a python 2-d plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits. A good way to see the matplotlib capabilities is to skim through the [documentation](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net), and more specifically have a look to the [Thumbnail gallery](http://www.matplotlib.sourceforge.net/gallery.html). See the Section [References](#VI) of this notebook to find more specific links to Matplotlib documentation.\n",

One needs to experiment to see what is localy available (while \"inline\" should generally work and allows you to keep your figure in the notebook, which is useful to share your work). If you want to make interactive plots, I advise you to do them within an `IPython` console. \n",

    "A common option consists in launching Ipython --pylab (or --matplotlib does the same thing nowadays), this is (essentially) equivalent to do `from pylab import *` in your Ipthon window (or in your Jupyter Notebook). In fact, `pylab` is nothing more than a module provided by `matplotlib` that pulls in everything in `matplotlib.pyplot` and a selection of useful functions/modules from matplotlib and numpy. See  [Matplotlib, pylab, and pyplot: how are they related?](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/faq/usage_faq.html#matplotlib-pylab-and-pyplot-how-are-they-related) for more discussion on this topic. Finally, note that in many examples you will see code like:\n",

    "#### IV.2 Function minimization and fitting: `scipy.optimize`    <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"IV.2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization of a function is an important aspect of many data analysis problems. The `scipy.optimize` module provides useful algorithms for function minimization (scalar or multi-dimensional), curve fitting and root finding. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus here on one of the most used application of minimization techniques which is $\\chi^2$ minimization, namely curve fitting. As you know, curve fitting consists in minimizing the *weighted sum of the squared residuals* (i.e. residuals being the difference between the model and the data):    \n",
    "$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{y_i - f(x_i)}{\\sigma_i} \\right)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to define ourself a function that calculates the $\\chi^2$ of a given model and use some the functions implemented in `scipy.optimize` to solve this minimization problem, we can also directly use the convenience function `curve_fit()`, that already does it for us. This function implements the \"Levenberg-Marquardt\" algorithm to find the parameters that minimize your $\\chi^2$ merit function. Conceptually, that method switch between the \"Gradient Descent Method\" (you perturb the parameters by some amount \"h\" in the direction of steepest descent in your $\\chi^2$ function), and the \"Gauss-Newton Method\" that assumes that locally your function is quadratic in the parameters to determine \"h\", through a \"lagrange parameter\" lambda that is modified depending of the observed change in merit function. The `curve_fit()` function works like this:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# first create a function that defines your model\n",
    "# It must take the independent variable as the first argument and the parameters to fit as separate remaining arguments.\n",
    "def func(x, p1, p2, p3):\n",
    "y = f(x, p1, p2, p3)  # replace f(x, p1, p2, p3) by a function of vector x with parameters p1, p2, p3\n",
    "    return y\n",
    "# Second we call curve_fit(), first three arguments being func, xdata, ydata. Next two are optional initial guess and errors on y. \n",
    "pfit, pcov = scipy.optimize.curve_fit(func, xdata, ydata, p0=x0, sigma=sigma) \n",
    "# there is the possibility to constrain the parameters to certain ranges using method = 'trf'\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can move to the next cell to see in details an example of curve fitting. \n",
    "Beware, the covariance matrix, that allows you to make a proper (i.e. statistically valid) uncertainty estimate on the fitted parameters, does only make sense in case of gaussian noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you are not too familiar with curve fitting/least square minimization, how to do when you have errors also on the independant variable (namely x), about difference between linear and non linear least-square (i.e. applied to linear and non linear models), about the basic concept behind the least square fitting algorithm ... I advise you to consult [Numerical recipes](http://www2.units.it/ipl/students_area/imm2/files/Numerical_Recipes.pdf) (Chapters 10, 15), and [Hogg, Bovy, Lang 2010](https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4686).
